# Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard

A detailed Power BI project that offers actionable insights into customer churn trends for a bank. The dashboard examines critical metrics such as customer demographics, account balances, and churn rates to uncover the underlying reasons behind customer attrition and the key factors influencing it.

## Problem Statement:
The bank aims to understand and analyze customer churn rates to improve retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. By utilizing bank data encompassing various attributes such as active membership status, age, balance, country, credit score, customer ID, estimated salary, lost customers, product number, and tenure, the bank seeks to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn. Specifically, the bank desires to examine churn status by gender, total customer count, total churn rate, and churn rate concerning credit score.

## Churn Rate Explained:
Churn rate is like a "leaving rate" for customers. It shows the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service over a certain period.

## Data Collection and Cleaning:
Collect comprehensive bank data, including details such as active membership, age, account balance, country, credit score, customer ID, estimated salary, churn status, number of products, and tenure.

Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, removing outliers, and resolving data inconsistencies to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Explore the distribution of churn status by gender.
Analyze the distribution of credit scores among churned and retained customers.


## Visualization:
Utilize visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to illustrate the following insights:

Churn by Gender: Use a bar or pie chart to compare the number of customers who stayed versus those who left, segmented by gender.

Overall Customer Count: Present the total number of customers using a simple visual such as a bar or pie chart.

Overall Churn Rate: Compute the percentage of customers who have churned and display it visually to highlight the churn proportion.

Churn Rate vs. Credit Score: Categorize customers into credit score ranges and use a bar or line chart to show the churn rate within each category.

## Conclusion:
A comprehensive analysis offers a clear understanding of churn status by gender along with overall customer count, provides insightful visualizations that reveal churn rates and their relationship with credit scores, and identifies the key factors contributing to customer attrition.
